# FavroToJira
Convert data pulled from a Favro project to Json format for Jira import.

This is a quick hack which I used to transfer one of my personal hobby projects from Favro to Jira. 
It contains lots of hard-coded stuff, few comments, and other untidy things. Consider it only as 
a starting point if you face the same problem as I did. You will need to adjust it to your needs.
However, feel free to improve it.
